      <h1>40 Laws Of A High Value Man</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 1 - HE IS NOT A BOY</h3>
      <p>
        Law number one: He is not a boy. To be a man doesn't merely mean your
        balls have dropped and you possess a bigger body. Nope, not at all. To
        become a man is to kill the boy in you. The boy consciousness must be
        eliminated and sent to the recesses of your being. When this happens,
        the masculine alpha consciousness emerges. <br /> <br />
        Today, we lack the rituals and processes to allow the boy to be
        intelligently killed. Rites of passage for men have all but been
        eliminated. Women are lucky in that they will always possess a natural
        rite of passage into womanhood. Modern society has an epidemic of
        man-boys, either an over-the-top neurotic individual chasing success or
        a general sense of no direction.
        <br /> <br />
        But here's the good news: we can now create our own rites of passage. We
        can develop our own means of entering into the mature masculine. This is
        known as the hero's journey, something every man has to go on but most
        don't.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 2 - HE IS NOT TENTATIVE</h3>
      <p>
        Law number two: He is not tentative. To be tentative is to be hesitant,
        to hold back. As I said in the introduction, this sort of behavior would
        have gotten you killed in a state of nature. You won't be mauled by a
        tiger for tentative behavior today, but it will slowly rob you from the
        inside. <br /> <br />
        To be alpha is to drop all tentative, hesitant behavior and start
        acting. Forget the cortex and go from your gut.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 3 - HE IS NOT A WHINER</h3>
      <p>
        Law number three: He is not a whiner. "Why does he have it better than
        me? Why can't I be as good-looking or as charismatic as him? Why isn't
        my life like this?" All questions the whiner asks himself. This could go
        on for years and years. It's a sign of insufficient action and laziness.
        Instead of solving problems, the whiner prefers to create trauma and
        complain.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 4 - HE DOESN'T BLAME ANYONE FOR HIS PLACE</h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Law number four: He doesn't blame anyone for his place. Piggybacking
        after the third law, a man who has fully expressed the alpha in him does
        not place blame on anyone or anything for his situation in life. It's
        easy to blame your parents or peer group for not being where you want to
        be. It's easy, and it may even be true, but it does you no good. Blame
        is a technique used by your ego to make your failure more palatable to
        your ego. When you begin to blame everyone and everything else, you lose
        control. Life just happens to you as opposed to you thrusting into life
        and constructing the life you want.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 5 - HE IS NOT TENSE</h3>
      <p>
        Law number five: He is not tense. How much tension are you holding in
        your body right now? Take a deep breath and feel how much tension you
        can release from your belly and shoulders. You'd be surprised at how
        much tension the average man carries around with him. When you are
        constantly holding your true self back, the musculature of the body
        activates. Your body fights to hold back your true self, resulting in an
        extreme amount of tension in the body. This can lead to deformities,
        disease, and a weaker version of yourself.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 6 - HE IS NOT RIGID</h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Law number six: He is not rigid. Similar to not being tense, the alpha
        is not rigid. To be rigid is to be in a constant state of anxiety,
        constantly on guard. It is to unconsciously be forcing your will onto
        the world via the body. To be rigid is to say, 'I won't' or 'I will.'
        Overcome this can be a great blessing, but its shadows are what are most
        commonly seen. Being rigid may allow you to reach a certain outcome, but
        it will block you from enjoying it. Eventually, you will become so rigid
        that you cannot feel; life will only exist in the mind. The body becomes
        a tool the mind uses to achieve some end. At its core, rigidity is a
        response to fear. The more afraid you are, the more rigid you are.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 7 - HE IS NOT A DAYDREAMER</h3>
      <p>
        Law number seven: He is not a daydreamer. Do you constantly daydream? Do
        you play out what you should have said or done? Do you prefer just to
        dream about life as opposed to living it? Daydreaming is a clear-cut
        sign of insufficient action. The man who does more daydreams less.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 8 - HE DOESN'T WAIT</h3>
      <p>
        Law number eight: He doesn't wait. Many men have an ideal of what they
        look like, how they act, and how they want their life to look. It all
        takes place in some unnamed future: once I get that promotion, once the
        kids leave, once I get in shape, once things are perfect, then I'll
        start really living. Here's the truth: perfection does not exist. There
        is no perfect timing or perfect life. There is no completion point. This
        is largely a construct of the mind aimed at holding you back from taking
        risks. Don't wait until the perfect moment; it will never come because
        it doesn't exist.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 9 - HE IS NOT GOOD LOOKING</h3>
      <p>
        Law number nine: He is not good-looking or he doesn't need to be good
        looking. How many men allow their looks to hold them back? They cannot
        accept that someone as hideous as them could be attractive to a woman or
        able to have core confidence. The fact is, looks are bullshit. There are
        too many examples to count of non-good-looking men being extremely
        successful in all areas of life to list. Furthermore, there is no true
        idea of what a good-looking man even is. Don't waste your time worrying
        about these trivialities. Do what you can to improve your looks, i.e.,
        work out, dress better, get a good haircut, but after that, drop all the
        thoughts about your looks.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 10 - HE IS NOT RICH, HE IS WEALTHY</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 10: He is not rich. Maybe you believe looks don't matter. The
        next exhibit you'll bring up is money. If he's not good-looking, then he
        must be loaded. You can't accept that a man's pure masculine essence is
        enough for him and the woman in his life. That's not to say be poor to
        get success; money is just not in the equation. The alpha could be
        swimming in dough or a vagabond. Money is a tool the alpha uses to
        authentically express his gift. He may have a lot or little; no matter
        what his bank statement says, he is always wealthy.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 11 - HE IS NOT A PICKUP ARTIST</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 11: He is not a pickup artist. When most people hear the term
        alpha male (High Value Man), they immediately conjure up images of some
        over-the-top guy trying to pick up chicks at the local bar or club. This
        couldn't be further from the truth. The alpha is given in abundance; his
        life, his mere being, is enough to attract women. He doesn't have to go
        out every night trying to reach a certain number of sex partners. This
        is a clear sign of insecurity.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 12 - HE IS NOT LONELY</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 12: He is not lonely. Modern society has done more to
        separate us than to bring us closer; however, to constantly be in a
        state of alienation and feeling cut off from the world is a sign of
        being cut off from life. It points to a sign of being alienated from
        your true self. It is a way of self-protection; you guard yourself from
        other people; you make yourself lonely to avoid rejection and
        humiliation.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3> LAW 13 - HE IS NOT UNCERTAIN</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 13: He is not uncertain. If no decision is made, nothing can
        go wrong, right? That's what uncertain people do. It's a clever way of
        avoiding responsibility or making mistakes. To be certain and to make a
        decision would risk the possibility of being wrong. To someone
        uncertain, this is terrifying. The golden image of themselves can't be
        risked, so they retreat from life and avoid decision.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 14 - HE IS NOT APATHETIC</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 14: He is not apathetic. 'I don't care, whatever, what do you
        want to do?' To be apathetic is to lack enthusiasm. The word
        'enthusiasm' derives from the Greek word 'enthusiasmos,' which means to
        be possessed by a god, inspired. When you go through life in a daze of
        apathy, you lose touch with the god inside of you. Your energy levels
        plummet, and depression sets in. Find your purpose and let it kill you.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 15 - HE IS NOT SOCIALLY CONDITIONED</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 15: He is not socially conditioned. In a sense, it's
        virtually impossible for any human living in modern times to not become
        socially conditioned. Social conditioning begins at such a young age
        that you aren't able to use your head, heart, and balls to stand against
        it. However, the alpha comes to know himself and where he is conditioned
        and seeks to destroy the socially conditioned habit. To help find the
        socially conditioned patterns, begin to question your fears and
        anxieties. Why are you the way you are? Your heart and body will soon
        reveal your truth and the truth that was handed to you by social
        conditioning.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 16 - HE IS NOT EMPTY</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 16: He is not empty. You can have achieved all the success
        that our society values, but once you open that proverbial treasure
        chest, you will find it empty. This is a sign of the emptiness in a man
        not living on his purpose. When you are not creatively striving toward a
        worthwhile goal and giving your gift, life becomes a bore. You instead
        seek to keep busy so you won't think of the time you're wasting, or you
        constantly drown your senses at the bottom of a bottle to completely opt
        out. The man who is fully in touch with himself is constantly working
        towards a worthwhile goal.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 17 - HE IS NOT APPROVAL SEEKING</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 17: He is not approval-seeking. So much of modern man's
        actions are done in hopes of seeking some form of approval. A lot of
        this stems from a need to gain approval from a father who wasn't there
        in body or in spirit. This absence conditioned you from youth to reach
        out for love; you have to be successful in order to be loved, you
        thought. This can manifest in the career path you take or how you
        present your personality. However it manifests, recognize and accept it.
        The fully expressed alpha acts from a sense of giving his unique gift,
        following his gut, and helping others, whether he gets approval or is
        killed for it, matters not.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 18 - HE IS NOT A CONSUMER</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 18: He is not a consumer. We live in a consumer culture where
        people attempt to fill the void in their heart by buying a bunch of crap
        they don't need: cars, clothes, mansions, random collections of this or
        that. Each new item gives an initial burst of energy and you forget the
        pain, but the novelty quickly fades. Consumerism can be in the form of
        material goods, food, paychecks, travel, etc. However, no matter how
        many toys you collect, they will never distract you long enough to
        forget that you aren't living on your purpose, that there is something
        bigger you should be doing. You can't get enough of what you don't want.
        The full expression of the alpha wants something that can't be bought:
        freedom.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 19 - HE IS NOT ENSLAVED</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 19: He is not enslaved. 'But I have kids, a job, a mortgage,
        a wife, responsibilities.' The inferior man has an uncanny ability of
        making excuses. No man who ever did something great had a perfect
        environment. Most of them had kids and a wife. There is nothing holding
        you back from giving your gift but yourself. You may shake your head and
        think otherwise, but there are too many examples to prove you wrong. You
        can either find your purpose and let it kill you or die in a sea of
        regrets and rationalizations. Either way, you are going to the same
        place.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 20 - HE IS NOT A BELIEVER</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 20: He is not a believer. I mentioned this in the
        introduction: the true alpha does not believe anything. He explores,
        experiments, and finds his truth. He is guided by his own gut and
        experience, not doctrine or dogma. That's not to say he doesn't have
        faith. To be a man, i.e., alpha, is to have more faith than your average
        churchgoer. The difference is in action. The inferior man has faith and
        accepts everything will just happen. Think of the phrase 'drinking the
        kool-aid' to better understand this inferior position. The alpha has
        faith and then acts, explores, and tests to come to his own conclusion,
        his own theory of everything.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 21 - HE IS AUTHENTIC</h3>
      <p>
        He is authentic. As mentioned in the beginning of this book,
        authenticity is the basis of all human existence. Uninhibited expression
        from a man's gut was the law; it still is and will continue to be so. In
        being your genuine self, you not only free yourself but you open the
        door for those around you to be themselves. This is power on an
        inexplicable level. The problem in modernity is the mass conditioning
        towards silencing the authentic voice that is inside you, silencing the
        alpha that is locked in a cage. This problem is only becoming more and
        more prevalent as social media becomes more pronounced. This is the work
        you must be doing: finding yourself and expressing as much as possible.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 22 - HE IS FREE</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 22: He is free. The priority of the masculine on a deep level
        is the mission towards freedom. The essence of the feminine is nurturing
        love. These are both two sides of the same coin, same goals yet
        different paths. To be a man is to be free in expression and
        physicality, in work, and in all other areas of life. It is an umbrella
        that covers the masculine; family and relationships will always be
        second to your deepest mission to freedom.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each man's mission will be unique to him, but they all move towards
        freedom in one form or another. This may sound selfish, but providing
        your family and loved ones with the fullness of your being for a limited
        time is much more meaningful than holding back the light in you and
        giving your family a lesser version of yourself. Spending hours with
        your family when you aren't on your mission is inferior to 30 minutes
        spent with your family when you're in full alignment with your calling.
        Freedom is alpha on a non-physical level. Find your mission towards
        freedom and make it your priority.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 23 - HE IS COMPASSIONATE</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 23: He is compassionate. It is a sign of inhibition not to
        care about others. The inhibited man is constantly preoccupied with
        himself. He doesn't love, but he desires to be loved. He doesn't give,
        but desires to receive. His shell is too thick to outwardly express
        compassion. At the core of his problems lies fear: he fears other
        people, he fears responsibility.
        <br /> <br />
        The fully expressed alpha is fearless and literally feels others; he can
        sense what help they need and provides it. He is able to accept love as
        well as give it.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 24 - HE IS GOAL DRIVEN</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 24: He is goal-driven. Man is a goal-striving species. We get
        doused with good feeling chemicals—dopamine and serotonin—the more we
        accomplish. That's why reaching a goal feels so good. We are wired to go
        after what we want in life. Now, this isn't any different from a plant
        or other animal on a fundamental level. Plants have a system in their
        genetic makeup that makes them naturally strive towards a goal of
        gaining more sun exposure. Lesser animals have a goal-striving device
        that guides them in their goal of survival.
        <br /> <br />
        Man is a species of higher consciousness; our goals transcend mere
        survival. But similar to a plant or animal, man does not need to know
        how this works. It is in the plant and animal's nature to move towards
        the sun or to maximize survival. You do not need to have an intellectual
        knowledge of how your goal will be accomplished; you need to know your
        mission and to simply begin to live it in a certain way that will bring
        about the accomplishment of this goal.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 25 - HE LISTENS TO THE OMENS</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 25: He listens to the omens. God largely reveals himself to
        man through visions and hidden meanings; some call these omens. Now, you
        don't have to believe in God to follow the omens in your life. Omens are
        signs that, for individual reasons, mean something more to you than
        their surface-level representation. It could be a dream, a rock, an
        event, or the bottom of a teacup; whatever it is, it is your
        subconscious coming into the physical realm to tell you something.
        <br /> <br />
        The fully expressed alpha recognizes the omens and follows them with
        courage.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 26 - HE IS LIGHTHEARTED</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 26: He is lighthearted. One of man's greatest strengths is
        his capacity for humor. Identify the things that matter most to you—your
        mission in life. For everything else, take a lighthearted approach, to
        laugh at it, enjoy it.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 27 - HE IS FRIENDS WITH FEAR</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 27: He is friends with fear. If you were absolutely fearless,
        would you be living your life in the exact way you are living now? Have
        you lost touch with your fears so much that you don't even know them
        anymore? The fully expressed alpha knows his fear like the back of his
        hand and is honest with himself and others about it. It is with him when
        he wakes up in the morning and when he goes to sleep at night; it's like
        a shadow that follows his every step. Why? Because he is constantly
        leaning into his fear. Every day, he is pushing his fear further and
        further. Fear is where real transformation occurs. You can either lean
        into it every day or retreat into a life of deluded comfort.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 28 - HE LOVES UNDERSTANDS AND APPRECIATES THE FEMININE</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 28: He loves, understands, and appreciates the feminine. Men
        have largely been conditioned to be macho jerks towards women; their
        emotional outbursts are looked at with a suspicious glare. However, the
        fully expressed alpha understands that feminine women operate on a
        completely different frequency than themselves. The feminine's main
        priority in life is maximizing love and nurturing relationships, whereas
        the masculine's main priority is maximizing freedom.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fully expressed alpha loves the feminine essence, all the tests, and
        emotions, because he knows that these make him fuller and stronger. If
        you find yourself blaming women or retreating from them due to traumatic
        past experiences, know that whatever happened likely came from a lack of
        awareness on your behalf. You either did not understand the meaning
        behind her messages or you weren't grounded enough with the alpha in you
        to give her what she needed. This doesn't mean all women are saints;
        they can be just as conditioned and inhibited as the average man. But by
        and large, women are still in touch with the core of their being and
        carry themselves more freely. The feminine is attracted to masculine
        freedom and a sense of direction, goal-striving. If the woman in your
        life is constantly nagging or giving you a hard time, it is a sign that
        you aren't being the strongest version of yourself. This is why the
        fully expressed alpha loves the feminine; they push him to higher and
        higher heights.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 29 - HE IS AN EXPLORER</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 29: He is an explorer. The fully expressed alpha is an
        explorer not just of his external environment but of potential and his
        internal being. He recognizes that there is much to discover in attempts
        to find out. This could be in the process of building a business or the
        process of self-discovery. A man goes into his cave, slays his dragon,
        and brings back the treasure to his people. Explore whatever enters your
        heart's desire. Bring back the treasure of your finding to your people
        so that they may be enlightened by your discovery.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 30 - HE GOES ALL THE WAY</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 30: He goes all the way. If you're going to try, go all the
        way; otherwise, don't even start. If you're going to try, go all the
        way. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs, and
        maybe your mind. Go all the way. It could mean not eating for three or
        four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail.
        It could mean derision, mockery, isolation. Isolation is the gift, all
        the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to
        do it. And you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it
        will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to
        try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be
        alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. Do it. Do it.
        Do it. Do it all the way. All the way. You will ride life straight to
        perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is. - Charles Bukowski

      <h3>LAW 31 - HE HAS GLOWING EYES</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 31: He has glowing eyes. A man's outlook on life is conveyed
        and observed by the brightness in his eyes. The eyes are windows to the
        soul, the only visible part of the body that is in direct connection
        with the brain. Bright eyes denote someone in high spirits, someone with
        a vision for their life and the lives of those they care about.
        Alexander Lowen said, 'Where the spirit is absent, the eyes are vacant.'
        To see is to do more than just process images; to see is to understand.
        Vacant, dull eyes are the mark of a man who has given up on his mission
        for himself. It is the mark of a man who looks around and only sees
        despair and depression.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 32 - HE IS VIBRANT</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 32: He is vibrant. The strings of a violin are made up of a
        synthetic fiber, the metal core. There is nothing inherently musical or
        beautiful about synthetic fiber with a metal core, but when the bow is
        brought to these strings and they begin to vibrate, some of the most
        beautiful, haunting sounds arise. The same occurs with the alpha's way
        of being. There is nothing inherently beautiful or powerful about a
        bunch of bones and tissues, but when they begin to vibrate, life
        happens. This is what being vibrant means: to be vibrating with life. It
        becomes a force that affects those around you, similar to a tuning fork
        that will begin vibrating when around one that has already been struck.
        <br />
        <br />
        The dispirited individual lacks vibrancy; they are markedly unalive.
        When you begin to fully express the alpha male that is in you, your body
        will come alive with energy and vitality that is infectious and affects
        everyone around you.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 33 - HE IS LEADING</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 33: He is leading. Being a leader isn't about being in
        charge; being a leader means people trust you enough to be guided by
        you. It means you trust your path enough to lead others. Many men are
        given the title or position of leader, either at work or in politics,
        but they lack integrity and authentic belief in what they're doing. You
        can sense it on an unconscious level; if you are following these people,
        stop as soon as possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the journey to become a leader, a man needs teachers and mentors.
        These are typically found in older men who did what this man wants to
        do. The problem in modernity is that so few men have truly taken the
        hero's journey; most of them have just done as they were expected to do.
        That's why I always say, don't take advice from any man over the age of
        40 without a heroic bent. Most men start dying at 30. By and large, you
        will have to start on the journey without a mentor or a teacher; along
        the path, you will find them.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 34 - HE IS A PRODUCER</h3>
      <p>
        He is a producer. As I said in part one, the fully expressed alpha is
        not a consumer, but it doesn't end there. It's one thing to give up
        conspicuous consumption, but you have to keep going. The alpha, in his
        full expression, is a producer. Instead of consuming parties, he starts
        them. Instead of consuming paychecks, he creates them. Instead of
        consuming experiences, he makes them happen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you understand and fully enter the producer mindset, your life will
        quickly take a change for the better. However, being a producer leaves
        you open to constant criticism from the swarms of consumers. It takes a
        certain power to keep producing in the face of constant criticism. The
        fully expressed alpha possesses this power in the form of courage.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 35 - HE IS COURAGEOUS</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 35: He is courageous. To be a producer is to create the life
        you want instead of waiting for it to come to you. To do this requires
        courage. Courage is something you grow like a muscle, and much like a
        muscle is strengthened by constantly stressing it and challenging it, so
        it is with courage. You constantly challenge yourself and lean into your
        fear, and your courage will grow.
        <br />
        <br />
        The English word 'courage' derives from the Old French word 'quraj,'
        which came from the Latin prefix 'cor-' meaning heart. To move through
        life with courage is to be guided from your heart. The first step you
        take from your heart is an act of courage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many men become interested in something they can feel a calling in their
        heart, but they lack courage. They prefer to talk about it or read about
        it or rationalize about it, but it doesn't make logical sense. They may
        say, 'The callings of your heart are never going to make sense on a
        rational level; the rational takes place in the brain, your calling
        takes place in your heart.' That's why courage is required to live a
        significant life. It's high risk but much higher reward.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 36 - HE DOES NOTHING</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 36: He does nothing. Most men shy away from the dating realm
        because they don't know what to do. 'What do I do? Where should we go?'
        Every day planned, they have to concoct some grand scheme to get the
        girl to like him, to make a good impression, to make himself seem more
        interesting than he really is. This is ass backwards. You aren't
        conveying your true self when you do this.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fully expressed alpha does nothing. He invites women into his world
        and continues to simply be. The problem with most men is that if they
        were to just be, meaning continue to do whatever they were doing, they
        indeed would be rather dull. A man not in touch with himself is likely
        just going to either drink too much alcohol to dull his pain or watch
        some movie on Netflix to escape his reality. That's his being state.
        <br />
        <br />
        The alpha, in his fullness, lives a rich, passionate life and has an
        aura so strong that simply being with him is enough for any woman. This
        is the same for male friends as well.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 37 - HE IS UNAPOLOGETIC</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 37: He is unapologetic. So many men walk through life in a
        constant state of apology; their very being is marked by a sense of
        non-deserving. Someone who blinks often or finds themselves
        unconsciously nodding their head has this problem; they don't feel they
        deserve to be alive, so they must not be seen. They don't take up much
        space; they make themselves small.
        <br />
        <br />
        The alpha moves through this world without apology. He knows, not
        believes, but knows that the world is made better by his existence. This
        does not mean he never says he is sorry or makes mistakes; rather, it
        means that he acts from his heart and therefore no act can be one that
        is looked back on with regret and would warrant an apologetic outlook
        towards life.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 38 - HE IS SURROUNDED BY SUPPORTIVE PEERS</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 38: He is surrounded by supportive peers. No man is an
        island. While it is beneficial for a man to practice extreme
        self-reliance, no man accomplishes truly great things without other male
        friends. The adage 'birds of a feather flock together' is true on many
        levels. Take a good, hard look at your friends. Do they embody the life
        you want? Would you follow your friends into battle? If you even have to
        think about it, then you need to question how much time you spend with
        these men.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fully expressed alpha is surrounded by others on similar journeys.
        His frequency is in harmony with them, and they connect naturally. When
        you begin your journey, you will find these men enter your life
        naturally. This does not mean you need to ditch your old friends; not at
        all. Old friends, contented and comfortable with life, can bring you
        back down to earth. You can laugh with these men, but on the hero's
        journey, you need to be surrounded by men that will push you when you
        begin to slack and catch you when you fall.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 39 - HE IS ALWAYS GROWING</h3>
      <p>
        Law number 39: He is always growing. The man who is living on his edge
        and following his heart's calling is in a constant state of growth.
        Where authentic expression is the basis of mankind, our evolutionary
        gift, if you will. Evolution and growth, in and of themselves, are the
        fundamental processes of everything. Personal growth happens when you
        set goals; the specific outcome of the goal is not as important as the
        personal growth that occurs on the journey to that specific outcome. As
        they say, 'It's not the destination that counts, it's the journey.'
        <br />
        <br />
        There is no reason you couldn't attain your goal right now, except for
        how you are. You'll find that when you change how you are, your goals
        become fairly easy to attain. Goals can be met by fluke chance, but when
        you evolve the very core of how you are, they become much more probable,
        because you evolve into someone where that is just what happens with
        you; it becomes the usual.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is the fundamental process of all life. However, mankind has
        largely removed themselves from this process. Evolution works on every
        level: biological, technological, consciousness level, etc. It works by
        exploring every available opportunity and every possibility, and
        choosing the one that returns the most profitable outcomes and
        discarding the unfavorable ones.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you cease growing, you begin decaying. There is no escape from this
        process; you are either growing or decaying. The alpha is moving more
        and more towards the achievement of his mission, ending in absolute
        authenticity and freedom, whereas the inferior man is holding back
        growth with tension and just chasing outcomes.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h3>LAW 40 - HE FUCKS THE WORLD</h3>
      <p>
        He fucks the world like the act of sex. Men enter the world with a
        thrust; this is how we make our mark. Some men either hold back and wait
        for the right moment or woman, which is typically an action based on
        fear. Others run around just inserting the tip into many different
        arenas or women, which is an egotistical numbers game based on the need
        for approval. And other men become so broken that they are impotent both
        sexually and spiritually.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fully expressed alpha absolutely ravishes life. He does not just
        poke around, getting mediocre results. He enters the world as he enters
        his woman: with absolute love, authenticity, and the fullest giving of
        his unique gifts. A man fully in touch with his alpha, a man living on
        his purpose, a man totally authentic and free, makes every day, every
        moment, an orgasmic thrust of his fullness. With each action he takes
        from his core, the flow of life is forced to mold around him, completely
        authentic, aware, and courageous. The fully expressed alpha fucks the
        world to smithereens with absolute freedom until his life ends in one
        exquisite ejaculation.

      {/* <h3>Conclusion</h3> */}
      {/* <p>
        Realize that the alpha male you see around you and find yourself paying
        attention to and respecting is not someone you can't be. There is
        already one caged up inside of you. My hope is that this text gave you
        some awareness of the cage and set your subconscious mind on a mission
        to get the alpha out in his fullness, your fullness, who you are at your
        core.
        <br />
        <br />
        Remember, if your only motivation to become an High Value Man is to be
        the cocky macho jerk kind of guy, thinking that these are the sorts of
        guys that women like, you are very wrong. That's the thinking of a boy.
        Furthermore, this text isn't about becoming the ultra-sensitive wimp.
        This text goes deeper than the superficial concerns of an ordinary man.
        It will effectively try to shape you to become an altogether better,
        more confident person, and someone who has complete faith in themselves.
        Whether you're trying to impress a woman you like or getting over some
        issues that haunt your past, by following the details of this text and
        understanding the related psychology, gradually you will be able to
        shape yourself into the complete alpha male, the strongest version of
        yourself.
        <br />
        <br />
        This text provides you with everything you need to know to gain an
        awareness of what an alpha male (High Value Man) looks like. You may
        already possess some of these qualities, but a true alpha is one that
        possesses all of these characteristics in their fullness.
