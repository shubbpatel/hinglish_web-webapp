        goal and giving your gift life becomes a bore you instead seek to keep
        busy so you won't think of the time you're wasting or you constantly

        manifest in the career path you take or how you present your personality

        the novelty quickly fades consumerism can be in the form of material
        goods food paychecks travel etc however no matter how many toys you
        collect they will never distract you long enough to forget that you
        aren't living on your purpose that there is something bigger you should

        most of them had kids and a wife there is nothing holding you back from
        giving your gift but yourself you may shake your head and think
        otherwise but there are too many examples to prove you wrong you can

        i.e alpha is to have more faith than your average churchgoer the
        difference is an action the inferior man has faith and accepts
        everything will just happen think of the phrase drinking the kool-aid to

        genuine self you not only free yourself but you open the door for those
        around you to be themselves this is power on an inexplicable level the
        problem in modernity is the mass conditioning towards silencing the

        move towards freedom in one form or another this may sound selfish but
        providing your family and loved ones with the fullness of your being for
        a limited time is much more meaningful than holding back the light in
        you and giving your family a lesser version of yourself spending hours

        gaining more sun exposure lesser animals have a goal-striving device
        that guides them in their goal of survival man is a species of higher
        consciousness our goals transcend mere survival but similar to a plant

        needed this doesn't mean all women are saints they can be just as
        conditioned and inhibited as the average man but by and large women are

        freely the feminine is attracted to masculine freedom and a sense of

        means you trust your path enough to lead others many men are given the
        title or position of leader either at work or in politics but they lack
        integrity and authentic belief in what they're doing you can sense it on
        an unconscious level if you are following these people stop as soon as
        possible on the journey to become a leader a man needs teachers and
        mentors these are typically found in older men who did what this man
        wants to do the problem in modernity is that so few men have truly taken
        the hero's journey most of them have just done as they were expected to
        do that's why i always say don't take advice from any man over the age
        of 40 without a heroic bent most men start dying at 30. by and large you
        will have to start on the journey without a mentor or a teacher along
        the path you will find them

        experiences he makes them happy once you understand and fully enter the
        producer mindset your life will quickly take a change for the better
        however being a producer leaves you open to constant criticism from the
        swarms of consumers it takes a certain power to keep producing in the

        power in the form of courage

        muscle is strengthened by constantly stressing it and challenging it so
        it is with courage you constantly challenge yourself and lean into your
        fear and your courage will grow the english courage derives from the old
        french word quraj which came from the latin prefix core meaning heart to
        move through life with courage is to be guided from your heart the first
        step you take from your heart is an act of courage many men become
        interested in something they can feel a calling in their heart but they
        lack courage they prefer to talk about it or read about it or
        rationalize about it but it doesn't make logical sense they may say the
        callings of your heart are never going to make sense on a rational level
        the rational takes place in the brain your calling takes place in your
        heart that's why courage is required to live a significant life it's
        high risk but much higher reward

        invites women into his world and continues to simply be the problem with
        most men is that if they were to just be meaning continue to do whatever

        constant state of apology their very being is marked by a sense of
        non-deserving someone that links often or finds themselves unconsciously
        nodding their head has this problem they don't feel they deserve to be
        alive so they must not be seen they don't take up much space they make
        themselves small the alpha moves through this world without apology he
        knows not believes but knows that the world is made better by his
        existence this does not mean he never says he is sorry or makes mistakes
        rather it means that he acts from his heart and therefore no act can be

        hard look at your friends do they embody the life you want would you
        follow your friends into battle if you even have to think about it then
        you need to question how much time you spend with these men the fully
        expressed alpha is surrounded by others on similar journeys his
        frequency is in harmony with them and they connect naturally when you
        begin your journey you will find these men enter your life naturally

        and following his heart's calling is in a constant state of growth where
        authentic expression is the basis of mankind our evolutionary gift if
        you will evolution and growth in and of themselves are the fundamental
        process of everything personal growth happens when you set goals the
        specific outcome of the goal is not important so much as the personal
        growth that occurs on the journey to that specific outcome as they say
        it's not the destination that counts it's the journey there is no reason
        you couldn't attain your goal right now except for how you are you'll
        find that when you change how you are your goals become fairly easy to
        attain goals can be met by fluke chance but when you evolve the very
        core of how you are they become much more probable because you evolved
        into someone where that is just what happens with you it becomes the
        usual this is the fundamental process of all life however mankind has
        largely removed themselves from this process evolution works on every
        level biological technological consciousness level etc it works by
        exploring every available opportunity and every possibility and choosing
        the one that returns the most profitable outcomes and discarding the
        unfavorable ones when you cease growing you begin decaying there is no
        escape from this process you are either growing or decaying the alpha is
        moving more and more towards the achievement of his mission ending in
        absolute authenticity and freedom whereas the inferior man is holding
        back growth with tension and just chasing outcomes
